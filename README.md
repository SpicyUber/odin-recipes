This is a website that contains my favorite recipes that can be made under 15 minutes. Whether you're in a hurry or just lazy, feel free to make any of these delicious meals in the comfort of your own home.

Things I've learned working on this project: How to structure a website in HTML5, How to add content (images, lists, paragraphs, links...).
