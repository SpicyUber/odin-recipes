    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry milk powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 medium banana, mashed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend oats in a blender until the texture resembles coarse flour.</li>
        <li>Transfer oats to a bowl. Add both flours, brown sugar, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li>Whisk together milk, egg, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl; stir in mashed banana. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture; stir just until moistened, then let batter stand for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a griddle with 1 teaspoon oil and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>    
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
